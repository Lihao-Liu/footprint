This is a spider for Google Translation website.

When I read pdf papers, sometimes I need to copy the entire paragraph to the website for translation. 
But there is an "Enter" between each line in the pdf file, which needs to be manually eliminated.
So I wrote a crawler file that can change the "Enter" of the input content into "space". And request resources from Google Translation Server through the web interface.

Run this program, you need requests, execjs and tkiner.
