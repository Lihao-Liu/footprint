This is a crawler for Google Translation website.

When I read pdf papers, sometimes I need to copy the entire paragraph to the website for translation. 
But there is a carriage return between each line in the pdf file, which needs to be manually eliminated.
So I wrote a crawler file that can change the carriage returns of the input content into spaces. And request resources from Google Translation Server through the web interface.
